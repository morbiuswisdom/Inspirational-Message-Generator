# 🌟 Inspirational Message Generator
A simple JavaScript program that outputs a brand-new inspirational message every time it runs.  
This project was built as part of the Codecademy *Full-Stack Engineer* learning path to practice JavaScript fundamentals, version control with Git, and running scripts in Node.js.

---

## ✨ Features
- Generates **unique inspirational messages** each run
- Built from **three randomized components**:
  - Motivational statement
  - Action-oriented advice
  - Positive encouragement
- Fully written in **JavaScript** and run with **(Node.js)**
- Beginner-friendly and easy to extend
- Lightweight, fast, and runs locally on any computer with Node installed

## 🚀 Getting Started
### **Prerequisites**
Before running the project, ensure you have:
- **Node.js** installed
- **Git** installed
- A code editor (VSCode recommended)

### 📦 Installation
Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/morbiuswisdom/inspirational-message-generator.git

Navigate into the project folder
cd inspirational-message-generator

### ▶️ Usage
Run the program with 
node script.js

Every run will display a completely new inspirational message, for example:
**Believe in your potential. Take one bold step today. You are capable of amazing things.**

### 🧠 How It Works
The program uses three separate arrays containing:
- Motivational statements
- Action advice
- Encouragements
Each time the script runs, it randomly selects one item from each array and combines them to form an inspirational message.
The logic is kept simple, clean, and easy to modify for beginners.
